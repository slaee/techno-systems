# Techno Systems

Merged systems:
- Class Management, Team Management, and Peer Evaluation
- Activity Management
- Spring board
- Teknoplat 


# Development

Requirements:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- node & npm
- python 3.11

Run `npm install` first in the `frontend` folder to install all the dependencies to avoid eslint errors.

To auto fix eslint errors open your VSCode User Settings JSON and add the following:
```json
"[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
},
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
},
"editor.formatOnSave": true, 
"eslint.validate": [
    "json",
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "html"
],
```

## Dev build for non docker backend django framework and frontend react

Comment out the backend and frontend services in the docker-compose.yml file.
We will only run the mysql and phpyadmin services.

Run the mysql and phpmyadmin services:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

#### Backend API
```
cd backend
```

Setup Python Virtual Environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Uncomment this line under `backend/backend/wildforge/settings.py`
```
# load_dotenv(os.path.join(API_REPO_DIR, 'nondocker.env'))
```


Run the migrations and the backend server:
```
python3 backend/manage.py makemigrations && python3 backend/manage.py migrate && python3 backend/manage.py runserver
```


#### Frontend React
```
npm install
```

then run the frontend server:
```
npm start
```

### Eslint and Prettier
If you are encountering eslint errors, uninstall `Prettier - Code formatter` extension in VSCode so that we will use only the `ESLint` extension. (Note: prettier is already included in our local eslint configuration)

If there is a chance that some files are not being formatted, you can run the following command:
```
npm run lint-fix
```

## Dev Build with Docker

To build and run the system use command:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

If you are changing some files and are not being updated in a specific container, you can use the command to recreate the service:
```
docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build <service_name>
```

## Run demo
React App:                  http://127.0.0.1:3000/

Django API with swagger:    http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/



# Cleaning the docker if you are running out of space

Must run this with git bash in windows or in linux terminal.
```
docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
